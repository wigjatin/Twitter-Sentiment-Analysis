## Problem Statement

Social media platforms like Twitter are flooded with opinions, reactions, and emotions. Understanding sentiment at scale is valuable for:

- Businesses tracking customer feedback
- Researchers analyzing public opinion
- Individuals filtering through online chaos

Manual classification is inefficient and inconsistent. This project automates sentiment detection with a robust NLP pipeline.
